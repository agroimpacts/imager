`stac-client`
=============

This directory contains software for interacting with a [STAC API server](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec) over HTTP.

Its structure mimics the structure of the scripts in the [`planet`](../planet) direectory,
focused on two analogies:

- "projects" in the Raster Foundry vernacular are ["collections"](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/v1.0.0/collection-spec/collection-spec.md) in STAC.
- "scenes" in the Raster Foundry vernacular are ["items"](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/v1.0.0/item-spec/item-spec.md) in STAC.

The server implementation we'll use for this example is [Franklin](https://azavea.github.io/franklin), it's easy both to get up and running locally and to deploy it to a cloud environment.

## Quickstart

The minimum you'll need to get started locally is to install a recent version of `docker` that also bundles `docker compose`.
You can find [installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for common operating systems in Docker's documentation.

Once you've installed docker, from this directory, you can run `docker-compose up`. This will create a contrainer running
a PostgreSQL database and another container running Franklin that communicates with that PostgreSQL database.

To verify that everything's running correctly, you can make a request for the landing page. This sample assumes that you have
`curl` installed, but if not you can also use GUI HTTP clients like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/api-client/).

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:9090/
```

## Adding data

To see the collections available in your copy of Franklin, you can make a request to the `/collections` endpoint:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:9090/collections

{"collections":[],"links":[]}
```

Looks like there's nothing there ðŸ¤” but this isn't too unexpected, we just brought up the server. 

### Creating a collection

To make our first collection,
we'll send a POST request with the following data:

```json
{
    "assets": {},
    "description": "My first STAC collection",
    "extent": {
        "spatial": {
            "bbox": [
                [
                    0,
                    0,
                    10,
                    10
                ]
            ]
        },
        "temporal": {
            "interval": [
                [
                    null,
                    null
                ]
            ]
        }
    },
    "id": "my-first-collection",
    "keywords": [],
    "license": "proprietary",
    "links": [],
    "properties": {},
    "providers": [],
    "stac_extensions": [],
    "stac_version": "1.0.0",
    "summaries": {},
    "type": "Collection"
}
```

To send the POST request, you can run the following bash command (I won't go into detail about the `curl` parameters since this is just one way to interact, and the less convenient one),
which sends the JSON above in a POST request to `http://localhost:9090/collections`

```bash
$ echo '{
    "assets": {},
    "description": "My first STAC collection",
    "extent": {
        "spatial": {
            "bbox": [
                [
                    0,
                    0,
                    10,
                    10
                ]
            ]
        },
        "temporal": {
            "interval": [
                [
                    null,
                    null
                ]
            ]
        }
    },
    "id": "my-first-collection",
    "keywords": [],
    "license": "proprietary",
    "links": [],
    "properties": {},
    "providers": [],
    "stac_extensions": [],
    "stac_version": "1.0.0",
    "summaries": {},
    "type": "Collection"
}' | curl -X POST -d@- http://localhost:9090/collections

{"type":"Collection","stac_version":"1.0.0","stac_extensions":[],"id":"my-first-collection","description":"My first STAC collection","keywords":[],"license":"proprietary","providers":[],"extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[0.0,0.0,10.0,10.0]]},"temporal":{"interval":[[null,null]]}},"summaries":{},"properties":{},"links":[{"href":"http://localhost:9090/collections/my-first-collection","rel":"self","type":"application/json"},{"href":"http://localhost:9090","rel":"root","type":"application/json"}],"assets":{}}
```

Now if you hit the collections list endpoint, you'll see that the `collections` key of the returned object has your new collection in it.

Collections are a container type -- in STAC APIs, every item lives in a collection.

### Creating an item

Once you have a collection, you can add items to it. An _item_ is an individual piece of GeoJSON metadata. The item holds metadata, and any data that those metadata are valid for live in the item's _assets_. Items look like this:

```json
{
  "id": "public cog",
  "stac_version": "1.0.0",
  "stac_extensions": [],
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [
      [
        [
          -15.0002052,
          28.9282827
        ],
        [
          -15.0002033,
          27.9371483
        ],
        [
          -13.8842036,
          27.9326277
        ],
        [
          -13.8737609,
          28.9235723
        ],
        [
          -15.0002052,
          28.9282827
        ]
      ]
    ]
  },
  "bbox": [
    -15.002052,
    27.9326277,
    -13.8737609,
    28.9282827
  ],
  "links": [],
  "assets": {
    "data": {
      "href": "s3://rasterfoundry-production-data-us-east-1/demo-cogs/s2-canary-islands-rgb-cog.tif",
      "title": "RGB COG from Sentinel-2 bands",
      "description": "Composite image from bands 4, 3, and 2 of a Sentinel-2 image over the Canary Islands",
      "roles": ["data"],
      "type": "image/tiff; application=geotiff; profile=cloud-optimized" 
    }
  },
  "collection": "my-first-collection",
  "properties": {
    "datetime": "2021-06-16T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

In this case, `assets.data` refers to a COG that lives on S3. You can POST that item to the collection you
created a moment ago like so:

```bash
$ echo '{
  "id": "public cog",
  "stac_version": "1.0.0",
  "stac_extensions": [],
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [
      [
        [
          -15.0002052,
          28.9282827
        ],
        [
          -15.0002033,
          27.9371483
        ],
        [
          -13.8842036,
          27.9326277
        ],
        [
          -13.8737609,
          28.9235723
        ],
        [
          -15.0002052,
          28.9282827
        ]
      ]
    ]
  },
  "bbox": [
    -15.002052,
    27.9326277,
    -13.8737609,
    28.9282827
  ],
  "links": [],
  "assets": {
    "data": {
      "href": "s3://rasterfoundry-production-data-us-east-1/demo-cogs/s2-canary-islands-rgb-cog.tif",
      "title": "RGB COG from Sentinel-2 bands",
      "description": "Composite image from bands 4, 3, and 2 of a Sentinel-2 image over the Canary Islands",
      "roles": ["data"],
      "type": "image/tiff; application=geotiff; profile=cloud-optimized" 
    }
  },
  "collection": "my-first-collection",
  "properties": {
    "datetime": "2021-06-16T00:00:00Z"
  }
}' | curl -X POST -d@- http://localhost:9090/collections/my-first-collection/items
```

Then if you list your collections items:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:9091/collections/my-first-collection/items
```

You'll see the item you created.

Most STAC interaction is pretty much like this -- it centers on items and collections, and sometimes
some extra metadata that you can attach to collections and items. Scripts in this directory will make that interaction
easier and do it with Python instead of bash commands.
